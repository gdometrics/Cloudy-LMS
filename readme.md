## Cloudy LMS

This is the team repository for the Cloud-based LMS. You should clone this repository and put in in
your www folder. 

All development should follow the specification laid out in the Design Specification document.
If you find any error in the document or code, please notify Mehdi as soon as possible. Note that
changing the public interface of the classes or any other entity in the code is not allowed. That's
why I created the stubs for the models, controllers and views: to avoid conflicts between the code and
document. Any changes needed should be notified.

** All discussion to be done on the Fb group. **
